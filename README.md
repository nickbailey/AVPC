# AVPC
A simple demonstrator for the effects of quantization on audio files. Written as a simple teaching demo.

You will get to load a sine wave, or a piece of music or voice sample,
then choose bit-depth and law of quatisation, and whether to add dithering.
You can zoom recursively into the waveform and observe the error caused
by the quantisation you've chosen.

It's worth noting that I've not put the wav files in this repo
(`Erlk√∂nig.wav` and `To_a_Mouse.wav`) because I don't have copyright
clearance for them. So maybe provide your own before trying to load
"music" or "voice" samples

# AVPC
A simple demonstrator for the effects of quantization on audio files. Written as a simple teaching demo.

You will get to load a sine wave, or a piece of music or voice sample,
then choose bit-depth and law of quatisation, and whether to add dithering.
You can zoom recursively into the waveform and observe the error caused
by the quantisation you've chosen.
